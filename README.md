## Kandy HID Driver for VDI

As part of the [Kandy VDI Toolkit](https://github.com/Kandy-IO/kandy-vdi-toolkit), the Kandy HID Driver for VDI is an optional component that enables the use of HID devices in a Citrix VDI environement. The driver is used in conjunction with the [Kandy HID SDK](https://github.com/Kandy-IO/kandy-hid-sdk) running on the VDI Virtual Desktop.

## Installation

This software is delivered in the form of eLux distribution packages. See documentation for your version of Citrix Workspace.

## Logging

Once installed, logs generated by the DLL are written to syslog and so can be observed in /var/log/messages. They have a prefix of `VDIHID:`

## Disabling the DLL

In a Citrix VDI configuration, the DLL can be disabled (prevented from loading) by modifying /setup/kandy.ini on the eLux Thin Client and setting RTC_HID to Off:

```
[Modules]
RTC_HID=Off
```
Note that this will prevent the kandy-hid-sdk running in the container/web app from communicating with HID devices.

## Known Issues / Limitations
- the Jabra Speak 710 is known to conflict with either the mouse or keyboard when offhook. A support ticket (299) has been created with the device vendor
